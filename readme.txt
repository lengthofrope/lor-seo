This section describes how to install the Buzz SEO plugin and get it working.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I find this plugin in the WordPress plugin repository? =

We as a development team use GitHub for all our opensource projects. WordPress only provides an SVN repository to host
the plugins. Since we stopped using SVN ages ago, we cannot be found on the WordPress plugin repository.

= Do you support automatic updates? =

Yes, once installed, the plugin checks the GitHub repository and updates the plugin from there.

= I found a bug! =

Please report it on our GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/nextbuzz/buzz-seo/issues) so we can check into it and
try to solve it in a future release.

= Can I disable the metaboxes in the admin interface for a certain post type? =

All non-public post types do not show the metaboxes on the admin pages. It is also possible to disable the metaboxes
for public post-types by using a filter:

`
<?php
add_filter('buzz-seo-disable-posttype', function($posttypes) {
    $posttypes[] = 'customposttypeslug';
    return $posttypes;
});
?>
`

= Can I change the name of the admin ui menu? =

Yes, this is possible by using the following filter:

`
<?php
add_filter('buzz-seo-menu-name', function($current_name) {
    return 'SEO';
});
?>
`

= Can I hide the SEO Grade output in the admin screens? =

Yes, this is possible by using the following filter:

`
<?php
add_filter('buzz-seo-show-grade-output', '__return_false');
?>
`
